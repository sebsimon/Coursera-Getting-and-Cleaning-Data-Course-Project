# CodeBook

This codebook is base on the Run_analysis.R script for the Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project.
Its main objective is to describe the steps performed and modifications made to the raw data until obtaining the final Data.

# Indentifiers
After cheking the Data two main identifiers where located for botth data sets.
 - Subjets.
 - Ativity.
 
# Modifications
1) Downloading the raw data.
  - The data was extracted from a folder called UCI HAR Dataset, to then be stored in a temporary file (temp), as it was a zip file.
  - The packages "data.table" and "dplyr" where downloaded from the library.

2) Geting and CLeannig Test & Training Sets. 
  - First each data has to be assigned to a variable accordinly  to the set.
  - After the Data was assigned the main identifiers  were named ( Subjets & Acvtivities)
  - Follow by assigng the features as column names for each set.
  - Since all 3 variables had the same number of rows and columns, respectibly for both data sets, were bind into separete sets.
  
3) Merging the Test & Training Sets. 
  - Both sets had the same column names and number of Features. Therefore could be bind by merging the rows.

4) Extracting only the measurements on the mean and Std for each measurements.
  -Since the "features" are already organice as character vectors, we just need to subset the desired data.

5) Implementing descriptive activity Labels in the data set.
  - The Activity labels variable was subtacted from the file and named.
  - Base on the previous Data set (Mean_Std_data), the desriptive labels replace the activity ones.

6) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - The feature names, colnames, were rename with specific alterations like following:
      .Acc = Accelerometer
      .Gyro = Gyroscope
      .BodyBody = Body
      .Mag = Magnitude
      .starting  with f  = Frequency
      .start with  t =  Time
      
7) Independent Data Set with avg. for each variable, each activity and each subject.
 - Base on the changes made in the previous step, the independet data set ( FinalData ), was created by summarizing the mean of each group.


# Features 
This are the features of the Final Data after all modifications.
