Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The porpouse of this README.md file is to explain the analysis files in a clear and udestantable manner.

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course made by Sebastian Posada D. The R script Run_analysis.R, base on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset,  does the following:
  
  - Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory (CProject).
  - Read and organice both Data sets ( Test & Training), asigining them column names in order to execute the project 5 steps required. 
  
 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Data Set named: Mean_Std_data
 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set ( Independent_DS ) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
  - The final data set is Named : FinalData.txt

# This Repo contais as well:
  
 - CodeBook.md : Code Book name the variables, the data and the transformations performed to tyde and    organice the final data set. 
 - FinalData.txt : Is the final result Data afer all the above steps as required in the course.
